	<h4>About Explore Glasgow!</h4>
	<p>The objective of our application is to provide people who like to share photos and the people who like to look at photos, a safe place to engage in the sharing of their photo collections of their city.
For the users, the application will provide tools to allow photo-owners to upload their photos, add tags, and input brief descriptions. They will be able to see the total number of likes for their photo post and be notified of new likes and comments received from viewers. They can also read and interact with people’s comments. The application will sort out the daily, weekly, monthly and overall most-liked photos by algorithm.
Users can like and comment on the photos. They can also add the photos that they like to their “Favorite” folder. Moreover, they can search for photos (using tags, location etc.) and sort the order of display by posted time or number of likes.
For the visitors, they can view the photos and register an account.</p>
